## My Git Hub App

This project is a Kotlin migration of [My Github App](https://github.com/ssmobile/mygithubapp)

The difference from this project to the other is that, instead of using AsyncTask and HttpUrlConnections to make the API calls, I am using Retrofit and RxJava to make the requests and store the results into the application.
